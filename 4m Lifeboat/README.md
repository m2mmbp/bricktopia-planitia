### Foamcore and Board 1/24 Scale Mockup ###

Collection of Rick Sternbach
This is a 1/24 scale mockup roughing out the interior structure of the 4-meter lifeboat imagined for the starship U.S.S. Enterprise NCC-1701-D. This spacecraft is an upgrade of the 3-meter version described in the Star Trek: The Next Generation Technical Manual (Pocket Books, 1991). The mockup shows the locations of all visible surfaces, including acceleration seats, equipment lockers, control panels, life support system, and entry hatches. The mockup was done for the DeAgostini Japan/Midsummer Books UK Enterprise subscription model and book project, now canceled. The lifeboat was featured in a test marketing of Issue #2 (see photo). A scan of the relevant pages will be included. The 4-meter lifeboat was designed by, and is from the collection of your seller, Star Trek TNG and Voyager Senior Illustrator Rick Sternbach. Thew mockup can be signed in gold pen.

### Complete Collection of ORIGINAL Sketches and Schematics ###

Collection of Rick Sternbach
This is a large collection of eighteen ORIGINAL sketches and six schematic prints detailing the exterior and interior of the 4-meter lifeboat imagined for the starship U.S.S. Enterprise NCC-1701-D. This spacecraft is an upgrade of the 3-meter version described in the Star Trek: The Next Generation Technical Manual (Pocket Books, 1991). Please pardon the large number of images. The sketches detail all visible surfaces, including acceleration seats, equipment lockers, control panels, life support system, entry hatches, RCS thrusters, and more. The six color prints are refined scaled versions of the pen and ink wall sketches. A separate lifeboat foamcore and board mockup was imagined at approximately 1/24 scale, and these sketches are partly in support of that mockup. The sketches and mockup were done for the DeAgostini Japan/Midsummer Books UK Enterprise subscription model and book project, now canceled. The lifeboat was featured in a test marketing of Issue #2 (see photo). A scan of the relevant pages will be included. The 4-meter lifeboat was designed by, and is from the collection of your seller, Star Trek TNG and Voyager Senior Illustrator Rick Sternbach. All drawings will be counter-signed in gold pen.

### U.S.S. Enterprise NCC-1701-D Lifeboat Design ###

Collection of Rick Sternbach
Want to get away? From an exploding starship, that is! This is a copy of a compilation of sketches, photos of a foamcore mockup, orthographic plans, and computer renders of the uprated 4-meter lifeboat deployed on the U.S.S. Enterprise NCC-1701-D. The 4-meter version involved a reworking of the 3-meter lifeboat detailed in the Star Trek: The Next Generation Technical Manual published in 1991 (yours truly was a co-author). Many new external and internal details are visible, including control panels, storage lockers, acceleration seats, inertial damping field emitters, thrusters, and pressure hatches. Twenty-three pages of sketches and notes, including eleven full color Canon laser prints of interior wall layouts and CG renders (including the cover) are assembled into one 11”x17” booklet, stapled and edged with heavy black bookbinder’s tape. This is an indispensable collection for any fan of Starfleet spacecraft, equally fun for the general design enthusiast or model maker. Look closely for the tip o’ the hat to 2001: A Space Odyssey’s zero-g toilet instructions. This volume is from the collection of your seller, lifeboat designer and TNG/DS9/Voyager Senior Illustrator Rick Sternbach. The cover is autographed in gold pen and each page is initialed.
